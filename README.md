# audion-receiver-3

New audion receiver modell, with tuned amplifier. This is the third model of this old radio version, it's fun and works very well. **Try it yourself.**

# The circuit

This circuit is similar as first and second version, but there is **tuned preamplifier** in this version. Why?

## Variable capacitor

You can find a simple variable capacitor from an old radio. You can see it here:

This capacitor have two parts on a shaft. One part for "channel selector" (bevor input stage), the other for oscillator section.

Luckily, you can find such a model, where the two parts have equal capacity. (In many case, the part of capacitor for oscillator have smaller capacity.) **If you find a model like that, you can use it in this circuit.**

## Tow parts of capacitor

**First part** is the channel selector. (red circle)

**Second part** is the resonant LC circuit for RF preamplifier in collector section.

The selectivity of this radio is increased by the LC circuit.
