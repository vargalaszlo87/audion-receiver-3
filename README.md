# üöÄ audion-receiver-3

New audion receiver modell, with tuned amplifier. This is the third model of this old radio version, ‚ù§Ô∏è it's fun and works very well. ‚ù§Ô∏è **Try it yourself.**

**I will make a video about it soon and post the link here.**

# ‚≠ê The circuit

This circuit is similar as first and second version, but there is **tuned preamplifier** in this version. Why?

## üîÄ Variable capacitor

You can find a simple variable capacitor from an old radio. You can see it here:

This capacitor have two parts on a shaft. One part for "channel selector" (bevor input stage), the other for oscillator section.

Luckily, you can find such a model, where the two parts have equal capacity. (In many case, the part of capacitor for oscillator have smaller capacity.) **If you find a model like that, you can use it in this circuit.**

## ‚ôä Tow parts of capacitor

Where should the two parts of the capacitance be connected?

**First part** is the channel selector. (red circle)

**Second part** is the resonant LC circuit for RF preamplifier in collector section.

The selectivity of this radio is increased by the LC circuit. (orange circuit)

## üìê How it works?

‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Channel selector:** 

This section is a tuned bandwidth filter. 

üò° What does it mean that selectivity is weak if there is only one resonant circuit in the radio? üò° The strongest radio station can be heard in the full band. 

‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Input** stage:

  - receives the antenna signal
  - make impedance transformation

‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Tuned RF preamplifier** stage:

Second bandwidth filter in collector section.

  - tunnable f0 of bandwidth
  - tunnable gain of amplifier

‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Audion with filter** stage:

  - signal demodulation
  - filter for smoothing the carrier signal

‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Output** stage:

  - separation stage between headphones and audion
  - make impedance transformation for headphone
